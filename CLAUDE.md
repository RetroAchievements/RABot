# Project Overview

RABot is the official RetroAchievements Discord bot, built with Bun runtime, TypeScript, Discord.js v14, and Drizzle ORM with SQLite. The bot is transitioning from legacy prefix commands (!) to modern slash commands (/) while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Initial setup
bun install
cp .env.example .env    # Configure environment variables
bun run db:generate     # Generate database migrations
bun run db:migrate      # Apply migrations
bun run db:seed         # Seed default teams (RACheats)

# Development
bun run dev             # Run with hot reload (--watch)
bun run tsc             # TypeScript type checking (via tsgo)
bun run format          # Format code with oxfmt
bun run format:check    # Check formatting without writing
bun run lint            # Run oxlint
bun run lint:fix        # Auto-fix linting issues (oxlint)
bun run test            # Run all tests (vitest)
bun run test:watch      # Run tests in watch mode (vitest)
bun run verify          # Format, lint-fix, type check, and test locally
bun run ci              # CI-safe checks without writing files

# Deployment
bun run deploy-commands # Deploy slash commands to Discord (required after adding/modifying slash commands)
bun run start           # Production mode
```

## Architecture & Key Patterns

### Dual Command System

The bot supports both legacy prefix commands and modern slash commands during the migration period:

1. **Legacy Commands** (`src/commands/*.command.ts`)
   - Use the `Command` interface
   - Accessed via prefix (default: `!`)
   - May show migration notices when linked to slash command replacements
   - Example: `!gan 14402`

2. **Slash Commands** (`src/slash-commands/*.command.ts`)
   - Use the `SlashCommand` interface
   - Built with Discord.js SlashCommandBuilder
   - Support autocomplete, better validation, ephemeral responses
   - Example: `/gan game-id:14402`

### Migration System

When users use legacy commands that are linked to slash equivalents via `legacyName`:

- A temporary migration notice appears (15 seconds)
- The legacy command still executes
- `!poll` currently keeps running without a migration notice
- The mapping is configured via the `legacyName` property in slash commands

### Database Architecture

- **Drizzle ORM** with SQLite through the libSQL client
- Schema defined in `src/database/schema.ts`
- Services pattern for database operations (`src/services/*.service.ts`)
- Tables: `teams`, `team_members`, `polls`, `poll_votes`, `uwc_polls`, `uwc_poll_results`

### Command Registration

- Legacy commands auto-loaded from `src/commands/`
- Slash commands auto-loaded from `src/slash-commands/`
- Slash commands must be deployed via `bun run deploy-commands`

### Key Services

- **TeamService**: Manages teams and members, supports both ID and name lookups
- **PollService**: Handles poll creation and voting
- **UwcPollService**: Tracks UWC polls, stores results, enables searching by achievement/game
- **UwcHistoryService**: Retrieves and formats previous UWC poll history for auto-detection
- **AutoPublishService**: Automatically publishes messages in configured announcement channels
- **GameInfoService**, **TemplateService**, and **YouTubeService**: Power GAN command data fetching and formatting
- **AchievementUnlocksService** and **ConnectApiService**: Support events and memory parsing features
- **GithubReleaseService**: Fetches release information for `/status`

### Environment Variables

Required at startup:

- `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Bot token (required)
- `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID`: Bot application ID (required)
- `RA_WEB_API_KEY`: RetroAchievements Web API key (required)

Feature-specific and optional configuration:

- `LEGACY_COMMAND_PREFIX`: Prefix for legacy commands (default: `!`)
- `RA_CONNECT_API_KEY`: RetroAchievements Connect API key required for `!mem` achievement ID/URL lookups and code notes
- `RA_CONNECT_API_USER`: RetroAchievements Connect API username (default: `RABot`)
- `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`: For longplay searches in gan commands (optional, but recommended)
- `MAIN_GUILD_ID`: Discord guild ID for the main RetroAchievements server (optional, but recommended for production guild authorization)
- `WORKSHOP_GUILD_ID`: Discord guild ID for the RetroAchievements Workshop server (required for Workshop-only features)
- `CHEAT_INVESTIGATION_CATEGORY_ID`: Category ID for RACheats team restrictions
- `GAMBLER_ROLE_ID`: Discord role ID managed by `/events gambler` (required for Gambler role commands)
- `UWC_VOTING_TAG_ID`: Forum tag ID for active UWC polls (optional)
- `UWC_VOTE_CONCLUDED_TAG_ID`: Forum tag ID for completed UWC polls (optional)
- `UWC_FORUM_CHANNEL_ID`: Forum channel ID for UWC auto-detection feature (optional)
- `DEV_CHANNELS`: Comma-separated channel IDs where `!mem` may show code notes (optional)
- `AUTO_PUBLISH_CHANNEL_IDS`: Comma-separated list of announcement channel IDs to auto-publish from (optional)
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to "production" in production (default: "development")
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level - trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal (default: "debug" in dev, "info" in prod)

**Note**: The bot will validate required environment variables on startup and exit with an error if any are missing.

### Discord.js v14 Patterns

- Use `MessageFlags.Ephemeral` instead of `ephemeral: true`
- Autocomplete handlers in main interaction event
- Proper intent configuration for message content access

### UWC Auto-Detection Feature

The bot automatically provides context when new UWC (Unwelcome Concept) reports are created:

- Monitors threads in the configured forum channel (`UWC_FORUM_CHANNEL_ID`)
- Detects threads matching pattern: `12345: Achievement Title (Game Name)`
- Queries database for previous UWC polls for the same achievement ID
- Posts an automated message with links to up to 5 previous discussions
- Shows poll dates, active status when relevant, and the top vote result when available
- Uses efficient database queries instead of Discord API calls for performance

### Auto-Publishing Feature

The bot can automatically publish messages in Discord announcement channels:

- Configure channel IDs via `AUTO_PUBLISH_CHANNEL_IDS` environment variable
- Bot requires "Manage Messages" permission in announcement channels
- Automatically publishes non-bot messages that aren't already crossposted
- Handles rate limits and permission errors gracefully
- Logs all publishing activities for monitoring

## Command Implementation Notes

### Adding New Commands

1. **Slash commands preferred** for new features
2. Create in `src/slash-commands/[name].command.ts`
3. Export default with `SlashCommand` interface
4. Set `legacyName` if replacing a prefix command
5. Add guild restrictions using `requireGuild()` utility if needed
6. Run `bun run deploy-commands` after adding
7. **Update README.md** - Add the new command to both the slash commands and legacy commands lists (if applicable)

### Guild Restrictions

Use the `requireGuild()` utility for server-restricted commands:

```typescript
import { requireGuild } from "../utils/guild-restrictions";
import { WORKSHOP_GUILD_ID } from "../config/constants";

async execute(interaction, _client) {
  if (!(await requireGuild(interaction, WORKSHOP_GUILD_ID))) {
    return;
  }
  // Command logic here...
}
```

- Provides consistent, low-cognitive-load guild restrictions
- Automatically sends ephemeral error responses
- Use `MAIN_GUILD_ID` or `WORKSHOP_GUILD_ID` constants

### Team System

- Teams stored by ID, accessed by name in commands
- Autocomplete support for team selection
- Special restrictions for certain teams (e.g., RACheats)
- Team commands restricted to Workshop server only

### RetroAchievements API

- Use `@retroachievements/api` package
- Build authorization with `buildAuthorization()`
- Handle game IDs and URLs in gan commands
- Memory parsing utility for achievement logic analysis (mem command)

## Logging System

The bot uses a small custom structured JSON logger with the following features:

### Log Levels

- `trace`: Most detailed logging
- `debug`: Detailed information for debugging
- `info`: General informational messages
- `warn`: Warning messages
- `error`: Error messages
- `fatal`: Fatal errors that cause the bot to exit

### Logging Utilities

1. **Basic Logger** (`src/utils/logger.ts`)
   - `logger.info()`, `logger.error()`, etc. for standard logging
   - `logError()` - Log errors with context
   - `logCommandExecution()` - Log command executions
   - `logMigrationNotice()` - Log migration notices
   - `logDatabaseQuery()` - Log database operations
   - `logApiCall()` - Log external API calls

2. **Error Tracking** (`src/utils/error-tracker.ts`)
   - `ErrorTracker.trackMessageError()` - Track errors from message commands
   - `ErrorTracker.trackInteractionError()` - Track errors from slash commands
   - `ErrorTracker.formatUserError()` - Format errors for user display with error IDs

3. **Command Analytics** (`src/utils/command-analytics.ts`)
   - Automatic tracking of all command executions
   - Execution time measurement
   - Success/failure tracking
   - Per-user and per-guild statistics
   - Access statistics via `CommandAnalytics.getStatistics()`

### Best Practices

- Always use structured logging with context objects
- Include user ID, guild ID, and command name in error logs
- Use appropriate log levels (don't use `info` for debugging)
- Error IDs help users report issues

## Production Notes

### Deployment

- The bot automatically deploys via Forge when changes are merged to main
- Runs under a process supervisor on the production server
- No manual PM2 configuration needed

### Database

- The database is a local SQLite file (`rabot.db`) accessed through Drizzle's libSQL adapter
- Migrations live in `drizzle/` and are applied by `bun run db:migrate`

### Shutdown Handling

- The bot handles SIGTERM and SIGINT signals for graceful shutdown
- Discord client connections are properly closed before exit
- Uncaught exceptions and promise rejections trigger graceful shutdown

## Testing

Tests use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) as the test runner (configured in `vitest.config.ts`). All tests run in both local development and CI environments.

## Common Gotchas

- Always use Bun commands (`bun run`, `bun install`) not npm/yarn/pnpm
- Deploy slash commands after changes (`bun run deploy-commands`)
- Check channel type before accessing properties like `topic` or `parentId`
- Use proper null checks for Discord.js properties
- Remember to handle both team IDs and names in TeamService methods
- Use `requireGuild()` for server restrictions instead of manual guild ID checks
- Always write tests for new utilities and commands (follow existing test patterns)
- The bot validates required environment variables on startup - check logs if it exits immediately
